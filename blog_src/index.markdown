# Making of 1kjs 

I've always loved the size compos, i knew them thanks to .the .product, an awesome intro in 64kb where farbrausch guys packed amazing graphics, sound, textures and so on. That demo is 12 years old right now and still looks pretty good. There are another good examples in [pouet.net](http://pouet.net) if you are curious.

Some weeks ago i knew about (1kjs)[http://js1k.com/], a compo to do whatever you want which fits in 1k of javascript code. 

I'm starting to make some serious projects with javascript and canvas so why not try to do some fancy in 1k, only for fun.

## the idea

I have a little background on game development, i worked in the past for a videogame company and i've always coded some little games so the idea was to create a simple game. I decided one push button, something really simple, like jetpack for ipad or canabalt. 

    {% highlight javascript %}

        function awesome () {
        }
    {% endhighlight %}
