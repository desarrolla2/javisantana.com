<p>During the Torque development (a small javascript library to create animations on maps) we decided to use a markdown template to write there the reference API documentation:</p>
<p><span><a href="https://gist.github.com/javisantana/6413167">https://gist.github.com/javisantana/6413167</a></span></p>
<p><span>some goodies about it:</span></p>
<p><span>- plain text</span></p>
<p><span>- easy to read without format</span></p>
<p><span>- plenty of tools to transform to html (or whatever)</span></p>
<p><span>- easy to parse if the project grows and it need to be transformed to something better</span></p>
<p><span>- <strong>nice starting point</strong>. Useful when you don&#8217;t know how/where to start</span></p>
<p>While I was coding I always had a vim window open with the documentation so I can update it at the same time I was changing the interface in the code. It&#8217;s the only way I&#8217;ve found to keep the API documentation up to date.</p>
<p>At the end this is another example of &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_Soup">stone soup</a>" story. In this case putting this file in a doc folder and opening it every time you start to code remind you need to update it.</p>
