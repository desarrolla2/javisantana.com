<p><div>This is the mail I sent to the internal mailing list in vizzuality some weeks ago when we started to prepare the next big release of <a href="http://cartodb.com">CartoDB</a> (probably it will be live when you read this post) with some guidelines to report bugs while manual testing is performed. <span>I think it might be useful for you:</span></div>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
<div><span>Hey guys,</span></div>
<div><span> </span></div>
<div><span>the following days we will </span><span class="il">report</span><span> </span><span>lot of</span><span> </span><span class="il">bugs</span><span> </span><span>(I hope not &#8230;) and there are some things we can do to improve the time they take to be resolved:</span></div>
<div></div>
<div>- we assume we work on chrome/osx. If you are using other browser/OS <span class="il">report</span> it, specially IE/windows. </div>
<div></div>
<div>- sometimes the <span class="il">bugs</span> can&#8217;t be reproduced easily, don&#8217;t worry, just <span class="il">report</span> it and write all the things you did, every detail is important and write you can&#8217;t reproduce always. This is very important because if you don&#8217;t say that we will mark it as invalid and we will spend some time discussing it</div>
<div></div>
<div>- please, don&#8217;t use &#8220;gets crazy&#8221;, &#8220;crash&#8221;, &#8220;does not work&#8221;, they don&#8217;t provide information and make developers feel bad, really. </div>
<div></div>
<div>- spend time reproducing and <span class="il">reporting</span> the <span class="il">bug</span>, if a <span class="il">bug</span> <span class="il">report</span> is good the resolution is easier.</div>
<div></div>
<div>- open developer tools (or similar) when you are testing, if you see a javascript error, <span class="il">report</span> it in the ticket</div>
<div></div>
<div>- do not assume things work in the way you think, please <span class="il">report</span> the expected behavior</div>
<div></div>
<div>- be smart <span class="il">reporting</span> <span class="il">bugs</span>. Maybe that wrong padding is important, but if there are 200 tickets with real important things that does not work <span class="il">report</span> it and add to a different milestone. Tickets are like inventory, keeping inventory cost money: <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2012/07/09.html" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2012/07/09.html">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2012/07/09.html</a></a></div>
<div></div>
<div>and the last one but not less important:</div>
<div></div>
<div>- we all feel bad when something does not work, especially when you are working so hard, so comments like &#8220;this is shit&#8221;, &#8220;this shit does not work&#8221;, complains and all &#8220;demotivational&#8221; stuff are not welcomed. </div>
<div></div>
<div>thanks</div>
